# LightGlue Call Contract Fix - Verification Checklist ✅

## Implementation Status

### ✅ FIXED: Template Feature Caching

**Requirement**: Template SuperPoint features computed ONCE at init and cached

**Implementation**:
- [x] `_load_templates()` extracts keypoints and descriptors using SuperPoint
- [x] Features stored as torch tensors (not converted to numpy)
- [x] Tensors stored on configured device (CPU/GPU)
- [x] Storage format: dict with 'keypoints' and 'descriptors' keys
- [x] Updated docstring explaining cache strategy
- [x] Updated logging to mention "cached as torch tensors"

**Code Sections**:
- Lines 240-248: Feature extraction keeps tensors
- Lines 253-259: Dict storage format
- Line 268: Log message about cached tensors

### ✅ FIXED: Flattened Feature Dictionaries

**Requirement**: Pass flattened feature dicts to LightGlue using rbd()

**Implementation**:
- [x] Prepare feats0 dict: {'keypoints': template_kpts, 'descriptors': template_desc}
- [x] Prepare feats1 dict: {'keypoints': frame_kpts, 'descriptors': frame_desc}
- [x] Call rbd() on each dict to flatten
- [x] Pass flattened dicts using **rbd(feats0) and **rbd(feats1)
- [x] Removed old nested 'image0'/'image1' keys
- [x] Removed redundant template_feats computation

**Code Sections**:
- Lines 560-575: Feature dict preparation and LightGlue call
- Removes template tensor recomputation

### ✅ FIXED: Match Extraction Using Only Matched Keypoints

**Requirement**: Extract and use ONLY matched keypoint pairs for homography

**Implementation**:
- [x] Extract matches0 tensor from LightGlue output
- [x] Create boolean mask: valid = matches0 >= 0
- [x] Get template indices: torch.where(valid)[0]
- [x] Get frame indices: matches0[valid]
- [x] Index into template_kpts using template indices
- [x] Index into frame_kpts using frame indices
- [x] Convert indexed tensors to numpy for OpenCV
- [x] Pass only matched pairs (M pairs) to homography

**Code Sections**:
- Lines 577-594: Match extraction with correct indexing
- No longer uses numpy indexing on feature tensors

### ✅ PRESERVED: Everything Else

**Unchanged sections** (verified no impact):
- [x] Homography computation (same cv2.findHomography call)
- [x] ID verification method (_verify_marker_id unchanged)
- [x] Safety guardrails (max_fallback_markers_per_frame, reacquire_interval_frames)
- [x] ROI preference logic (prefer_roi_matching unchanged)
- [x] Corner refinement (corner_refine logic unchanged)
- [x] Output format validation (shape (4,2), dtype float32)
- [x] Source annotations (still "lg_reacquire" and "lg_track")
- [x] Worker integration (worker.py unchanged)

## Device Handling

### ✅ Consistent Device Management

- [x] Template tensors created on self.device
- [x] Frame features computed on self.device  
- [x] rbd() operates on tensors on device
- [x] LightGlue called with tensors on device
- [x] Only convert to numpy after indexing
- [x] No unnecessary GPU↔CPU transfers

**Device Flow**:
```
self.device (CPU/GPU)
  ↓
Load templates: tensors stay on device
  ↓
Extract frame features: on device
  ↓
rbd() flattening: on device
  ↓
LightGlue matching: on device
  ↓
Tensor indexing: on device
  ↓
Convert to numpy: only for homography input
  ↓
Return: numpy corners
```

## Code Quality

### ✅ Docstring Updates

- [x] _load_templates(): Added explanation of caching strategy
- [x] _reacquire_from_template(): Added "Uses cached template features" note
- [x] Match extraction comments explain torch.where() usage
- [x] Feature dict preparation comments explain rbd() purpose

### ✅ Type Consistency

- [x] self.templates type annotation updated (Tuple → Dict)
- [x] Variable names clear: template_kpts, template_desc, frame_kpts, frame_desc
- [x] Comments explain tensor shapes

### ✅ Error Handling

- [x] Checks valid.sum() >= min_inliers before processing
- [x] Checks H is not None before inlier check
- [x] Checks inliers >= min_inliers after RANSAC
- [x] Returns None, None on failure

## Testing Readiness

### What to Test

1. **Template Loading**
   - [ ] Verify templates dir found and parsed
   - [ ] Check log messages mention "cached as torch tensors"
   - [ ] Verify keypoint count is correct

2. **Feature Matching**
   - [ ] Run validate_lightglue_on_session.py
   - [ ] Check markers are recovered via template reacquire
   - [ ] Compare old vs new recovery time (should be ~6× faster)

3. **Match Quality**
   - [ ] Verify match count is sufficient
   - [ ] Check recovered corners are accurate
   - [ ] ID verification passes on recovered corners

4. **Device Handling**
   - [ ] Run on CPU and GPU
   - [ ] Verify no CUDA memory errors
   - [ ] Check tensor device consistency

5. **Safety Features**
   - [ ] Verify max_fallback_markers_per_frame limit works
   - [ ] Verify reacquire_interval_frames respected
   - [ ] Verify ROI preference used when available

## Syntax Verification

```
Command: python -m py_compile camera_fusion/fallback/lightglue_fallback.py
